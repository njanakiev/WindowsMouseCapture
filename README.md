# WindowsMouseCapture
This light-weight command-line-tool collects the coordinates of your mouse on the screen.

# Usage
The program is executed with:

```bash
MouseCapture.exe [OUTPUT FILE] ([SAMPLE RATE])
```

You can specify the output file of the mouse tracking and the sampling rate that is used. The sampling rate can be between 1 and 1000 (times per second) and is by default 10. You can stop the mouse tracking by pressing `CTRL ALT SHIFT F9`.
